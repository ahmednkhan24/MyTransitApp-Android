## University of Illinois at Chicago East Campus MyTransitApp - CTA Version

The final project that I did during my time in the course IT202 during the Spring 2018 semester at UIC was to create an app that was a CTA Bus/Train tracker for UIC East Campus. The user is able to track any CTA bus that is on campus, and also the blue line trains that are on campus.

Seeing that most students would prefer to have an actual app downloaded to their phones, I decided to recreate my app, but for Android devices.
